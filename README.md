# Temple-Trap-PyGame

This project is a desktop version of the game ["Temple Trap"](https://www.smartgames.eu/uk/one-player-games/temple-trap) by "SmartGames".

## Installation

In order to be able to play the game (on Windows) there are a couple of things you have to do.

1. Download and install the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/).
Make sure that you check the box "Add Python to PATH" when installing.
2. Install the necessary packages for this project.
This can be done by using the Windows command prompt.
In order to get there, just open Windows search by pressing the Windows button on the keyboard and then type "cmd".
Once inside, execute the following commands:

```
pip install pygame
pip install numpy
```

3. Download (as .zip and unpack) or clone this repository.
In the repository folder there is a .bat-file.
By double clicking it, python will execute main.py, which in turn runs the application.

4. Optionally, you can create a shortcut to the .bat-file and assign an icon to it.
Just open the properties of the shortcut and click the lower middle button that says "Change Icon...".
Then select the icon file icon.ico, which is located somewhere in this repository.

For information regarding the application itself, please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/MrRichardWhite/Temple-Trap-PyGame/wiki) of this repository.
